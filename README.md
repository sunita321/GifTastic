Giphy API, JavaScript and jQuery

This is a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 

* This trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed -- without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
  * If the player runs out of time, the player is told time's up and the correct answer is displayed. Wait a few seconds, then the next question shown.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player told they selected the wrong option and then the correct answer is displayed. Wait a few seconds, then the next question is shown.

* On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is shown (without reloading the page).
